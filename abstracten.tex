We never stop the exploration of the outer space. Since 1900s, astronomers have observed all over the sky to seek origin of life. Apart from observing stars, we may simulate the outer space environments and make some simple molecules in laboratories on the earth now. In 2002, a group of Japanese and US scientists (Miyakawa et al. (2002)\cite{miyakawa2002cold}) used NH$_4$CN, which was placed in -78 $^o$C for 27 years, discovered adenine. CN$^-$ is believed as the origin of amino CN group. To investigate the formation of CN$^-$, we deposite CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ (mechanism proposed by Kim and Kaiser (2011)\cite{kim}) at 15 K and 1 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ torr to demonstrate the surface of Charon. We provide VUV and EUV irradiations as energy sources and mainly use Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and Quadrupole Mass Spectroscopy (QMS) to study different concentrations of CH$_4$ to NH$_3$ ice mixtures.
