\chapter{\protect Results and Discussions}

According to Grundy et al. (2016), CH$_4$ from Pluto may accumulate by cold-trapping, onto surface of Charon. The amount of CH$_4$ varies throughout the surface of Charon because it depends on duration of temperature below 25 K. The duration depends on diurnal motion and thermal inertia of Charon. With a tilted axis of 112 degrees to the ecliptic, higher concentration of CH$_4$ will accumulate at the pole (see chapter 1 for details). Therefore, we investigate different concentrations of CH$_4$+NH$_3$ ice mixtures and answer several questions: Will different concentration of CH$_4$ mix with high concentration of ammonia observed on crater position and throughout the surface of Charon (Grundy et al. 2016) have structure difference in accumulation of tholin? Are there variations of photo-products when concentration of CH$_4$ differ during warm-up? Since both EUV and VUV irradiation irradiates onto Charon, are there any differences when we change the photon source from VUV to EUV to irradiate the ice mixtures?\\

The main source to irradiate the dark side of Charon is Lyα reflected by interplanetary medium (Grundy 2016). Other sources such as the energetic ions in solar wind, consists of mainly H$^+$, He$^+$, He$^{++}$ and O$^{2+}$ etc are originated from solar corona or IPM. These ions would also reflect solar irradiation to the dark side of Charon. Among these irradiations, we picked He II irradiation because He II is 3 – 20 times more intense then He I during a solar flare. As it varies, it is difficult to estimate the dose onto Charon. Besides, electronic flux is also present in solar wind but it is one order of magnitude lower than proton flux. The flux for energetic electrons observed at the 1 A. U. position is available (http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/goes-electron-flux). Although electron flux is much less important than Lyα, and their flux varies, we also compare the electron irradiation experiment done by Kim and Kaiser (2011) on CH$_4$+NH$_3$ ice mixtures in this chapter. \\

When Charon is shine by direct sun light, the surface temperature increases and deliver the heat to the poles by conduction. From the model of Grundy et al. (2016), the surface temperature of the pole area would increase to 60 K that the heating rate depends on the thermal conductivity of Charon. To demonstrate the heating process, we warmup our ice mixture with a heating rate 1 K/min and monitor the ice by both QMS and scanning IR spectra with 5 K intervals. We will look into whether there are new species formed during warmup and monitor the gas phase desorption.\\

Finally, in this chapter, after we focus on the concentration effect of CH$_4$ on photo-products, photon energy effects, species detected during warmup phases, we present the residues accumulated by irradiating CH$_4$+NH$_3$ ice mixtures with different ratios. Since both tholin formed on Titan and Charon has similar colour, we also compare the IR spectra of MDHL, NSRRC with different configurations with the residues on Titan with experiments done by Imanaka et al.\\
\section{The infra-red spectrums and peaks identification}
Before and after deposition, we scanned an IR spectrum and plotted the absorbance of the ice mixtures. Figure \ref{fig:widerange} is a plot of the absorbance of the CH$_4$+NH$_3$ ice mixtures in different ratios of CH$_4$+NH$_3$ ice mixtures, from top to bottom 1:20, 1:10, 1:5 and 3:2. We have labelled the peaks which we used to calculate the column densitiesby dotted lines throughout the graph. Main products we have detected are C$_2$H$_6$, CN$^-$ and C$_3$H$_8$. The peak positions with the references are listed in Table \ref{tab:WavenumberMDHL}.\\

We integrated the area and divided by the absorption strength stated in table 3.2. Although we understand that there is an average error in absorption strengths of no more than 10 \%  when the pure ice is diluted in N$_2$ and H$_2$O (Richey and Gerakines 2012). In our case, absorption strengths changes after CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ are mixed. For example, according to d' Hendecourt and Allamandola (1986), the band of NH$_3$ located at 1070 cm$^{-1}$ would not change much (from $1.1 \times 10^{-17}$ to $1.2 \times 10^{-17}$) when excess water is added to pure NH$_3$ and therefore, we may use the same absorption strength throughout our discussion to give a brief concept on what is the column density of the species and how is the absorption area changes when concentrations of ice mixtures and photon energy are changed. For the case of CN$^-$, we know that CN$^-$ has a bond order =3 by its molecular orbitals which is different from CN stretching (bond order 2.5) which is very sensitive to the matrix environment. As an example, by Borget et al. (2012), the CN stretch in amino acetonitrile change by factor of 2 between the pure molecule itself and in a mixture of amino acetonitrile and H$_2$O (1:3). Here, we adopt the absorption strengths stated in Table \ref{tab:Absorbance} and neglect the error in absorption strengths.\\

\section{Reaction mechanisms}

\subsection{C$_2$H$_6$}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter3/C2H6.eps}
\caption{The the infra-red spectrum of CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ ice mixtures of C$_2$H$_6$ and C$_3$H$_8$ before irradiation (dashed) and VUV irradiated ice mixtures provided by MDHL. }
\label{fig:C2H6}
\end{figure}

The assignment of C$_2$H$_6$ is confirmed by several bands listed in table \ref{tab:WavenumberMDHL}. Figure \ref{fig:C2H6} is a partial of figure \ref{fig:widerange}. The absorption peak located at 2075 cm$^{-1}$ is the strongest vibration of C$_2$H$_6$. The formation mechanism of C$_2$H$_6$ in astrophysical environment is proposed by Bennet et al. (2006), that the main route to form C$_2$H$_6$ is by a combination of 2 CH$_3$ radicals (equation \ref{eq:CH3} and \ref{eq:C2H6}):

\begin{equation}
CH_4 + hv \rightarrow CH_3
\label{eq:CH3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
2 CH_3 \rightarrow C_2H_6
\label{eq:C2H6}
\end{equation}

The energy required to produce 1 CH$_3$ radical from CH4 is 4.42 eV. 2 CH$_3$ radicals recombine to form C$_2$H$_6$ releases 3.74 eV. Therefore, equation \ref{eq:C2H6} is a no-barrier exothermic process. However, C$_2$H$_6$ is not detected in CH$_4$+NH$_3$=1:20 ice mixtures. Figure \ref{fig:lab_C2H6} shows the temporal formation column density of C$_2$H$_6$ in different configurations of irradiated ice mixtures.  As the formation only depends on CH$_4$, we may use first order kinetics equation to fit the column density versus photon dose.
\begin{equation}
[A] = [A]_0(1 - e^{-k_1 t})
\label{eq:1step}
\end{equation}
to fit the formation of C$_2$H$_6$. The fitting results are shown in table \ref{tab:fittingC2H6}.

\hline
\hline
Ratio of CH$_4$+NH$_3$ & A (x10$^{15}$ molecules cm$^{-2}$) & k (x10$^{-17}$ photon$^{-1}$) \\

1:5 & 4.16 $\pm$ 0.28 & 2.28 $\pm$ 0.28 \\
3:2 & 19.2 $\pm$ 0.15 & 5.28 $\pm$ 0.25 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

From table \ref{tab:fittingC2H6}, production rate is also proportional to the initial CH$_4$ concentration.


\subsection{C$_3$H$_8$}

The peak positioned at 2960 cm$^{-1}$ belongs to –CH$_2$- so we assigned that as C$_3$H$_8$, as the shortest carbon chain. The signal to noise ratio in CH$_4$+NH$_3$ = 1:10 is poor that we can not quantize the amount of C$_3$H$_8$ (figure \ref{fig:C2H6}).

It is a secondary product formed by a combination of either C$_2$H$_6$ + CH$_2$ (equation \ref{eq:C3H81})or C$_2$H$_4$ + CH$_4$ (equation \ref{eq:C3H82}).
\begin{equation}
C_2H_6 + CH_2 \rightarrow C_3H_8
\label{eq:C3H81}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_2H_4 + CH_4 \rightarrow C_3H_8
\label{eq:C3H82}
\end{equation}

By modern peak fitting method, we deconvoluted the overlapped C$_2$H$_6$ and C$_3$H$_8$ into two gaussians.

\subsection{CN$^-$}

\label{fig:CN}
\end{figure}

From infra-red absorption spectrum (figure \ref{fig:CN}) and their positions, we assigned the peak 2086 cm$^{-1}$ to CN$^-$  but not a combination of HCN and CN$^-$. The assignment is based on a absence in CN bending mode at 848 cm$^{-1}$. In the case CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ = 3:2, we may observe a peak located at 820 cm$^{-1}$, which is with a FWHM half of HCN and it is eliminated at 50 K during the warm-up phase. Since 50 K is the desorbing temperature of C$_2$H$_6$ and the peak position is the close to v12 mode of C$_2$H$_6$, we believe that the 820 cm$^{-1}$ peak is contributed by C$_2$H$_6$. Therefore, we may assign our peak located at 2086 cm$^{-1}$ as purely CN$^-$.\\

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter3/CNmechanism}
\caption{The formation mechanism of CN$^-$ proposed by Kim and Kaiser(2011). }
\label{fig:CNmechanism}
\end{figure}

The formation mechanism by of CN$^-$ at low temperature was first suggested by Kim and Kaiser (2011) to be two step reaction mechanism with methylamine as intermediate. CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ irradiated by photon to become CH$_3$ and NH$_2$ radical (figure \ref{CNmechanism}, followed by propagation and recombination of radicals becoming CH$_3$NH$_2$ and dehydrogenation and acid-base reaction to form CN$^-$.
Although Kim and Kaiser used 1.5keV electron as energy source to simulate the cosmic ray induced photochemistry, this formation mechanism also applies in our photon irradiation experiments because we can also detect the methylamine during our warm-up phase. The ion fragment with m/z=31 is assigned as CH$_3$NH$_2$$^+$ and detectable in all ratios of our CH$_4$+NH$_3$ experiments (figure \ref{Mass31}).

\caption{The m/z=31 detected by QMS during warm-up with heating rate 1 K/min in different configurations of ice mixtures.}
\label{fig:CNmechanism}
\end{figure}

By the deviation performed in section \ref{sec:Reaction_Rate_Laws}, we have a rate equation for consecutive reactions \ref{eq:rate7}. With one of the reactant larger than another, we applied the pseudo first order assumption. With equation \ref{eq:rate7}, we fitted the formation of CN$^-$ (figure \ref{fig:CNrate})and found that one of the rate constant is always larger than the other in all of the ratios. The fitting results are averaged by more than two experiments and are shown in table \ref{tab:CNrate}.The results of Kim and Kaiser is also listed into the table, they can observe a two-step reaction mechanism in production of CN$^-$ in CH4+NH3 (3:1) experiments with electron current 0.1 μA. However, when they increased the electron flux to 1 μA to irradiation C$_n$H$_{2n+2 (n=1-6)}$ and NH$_3$ ice mixtures, they also observed a one-step reaction mechanism.

\section{The Concentration Effect in formation of CN$^-$ and C$_2$H$_6$}

\subsection{CN$^-$}

From table \ref{tab:CNrate}, we may see that the rate k$_1$ is proportional to the concentration of CH$_4$. The rate constant k$_1$ increases when concentration of CH$_4$ increases. Since NH$_3$ is fixed in all of our experiments, more CH$_4$ are evolved into CH$_3$ radical formation when proportion of CH$_4$ in the ice mixture increases. More abundant CH$_3$ radicals in the ice mixtures would produce more CH$_3$NH$_2$ intermediates.

In CH$_4$+NH$_3$ =3:2 ice mixtures, A is half of the other ratios. The reduction is mainly because CN$^-$ has a competing relationship with formation of C$_2$H$_6$ and C$_3$H$_8$. NH$_2$ radicals competes with CH$_2$, CH$_3$ and C$_2$H$_4$ radicals. With this competition, the intermediate CH$_3$NH$_2$ is reduced. Therefore, in ratio 3:2 CH$_4$+NH$_3$ ice mixture, the yield of CN$^-$ is the least(table \ref{tab:CNrate}). Note that the formation yield of C2H6 is the maximum in this ratio (table \ref{tab:fittingC2H6})


Considering the normalized CN$^-$ with respect to the initial CH$_4$(figure \ref{fig:CN_CH4}), the formation of CN$^-$ is more effective in low CH$_4$ concentration ice mixtures. The mobile CH$_3$ radical is aggregated by excess NH$_3$. In this situation, CH$_3$ radicals have less chance to meet another CH$_3$ radical or C$_2$H$_4$. It is more likely to react with NH$_2$ radicals so the formation of CN$^-$ in low CH$_4$ concentration ice mixtures are more efficient.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter3/CN_CH4.eps}
\caption{The column density of CN$^-$ divided by initial CH$_4$ accumulated when different configurations of CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ ice mixtures are irradiated by VUV photons provided by MDHL.}
\label{fig:CN_CH4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{C$_2$H$_6$ and C$_3$H$_8$}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter3/Lab_C2H6_CH4.eps}
\caption{The column density of C$_2$H$_6$ divided by initial CH$_4$ accumulated when different configurations of CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ ice mixtures are irradiated by VUV photons provided by MDHL.}
\label{fig:C2H6_CH4}
\end{figure}

%Considering the case of C2H6, while we expected to observe a different trend, however, it also shows that CH4 with lower concentration is more effective for one CH3 radical to combine with another CH3. Why CH3 radicals aggregated by NH3 is still more efficient to form?  Let us consider the ratios between C2H6 (terminated -CH3 peak 2975 cm-1) and C3H8 (conjugated -CH2- with peak 2960 cm-1). Figure 3.1.7 is the plot with column densities of C2H6/ C3H8. We may see that the ratio in CH4+NH3 =1:5 experiment is around 6 where CH4+NH3 =3:2 is around 3. This shows that the amount of C3H8 in CH4+NH3 =3:2 experiment is higher. It is rather difficult for C3H8 to form in CH4+NH3 = 1:5 experiments because NH3 aggregated them. The formation of C3H8 in CH4+NH3 =1:5 and 3:2 experiments has given a reasonable explanation about why C2H6 formation is most efficient in CH4+NH3 =1:10 experiments.


%We calculated the percentage of photons absorbed by CH4+NH3 ice mixtures in different configurations. Applying cross-sections measured by Cruz-Diaz et al. (2014) and the spectrum of our MDHL and substitute them into beer’s law. In CH4+NH3 = 3:2 ice mixtures with ammonia fixed at 600 ML can absorb more than 99.9 % of light. Therefore, we may assume all the irradiated light is absorbed by the ice. For CH4+NH3 =3:2 ice mixture, around 9 x 10 17 photons were irradiated in 270 minutes.
%In Kim & Kaiser (2011) electron irradiation experiments, the energy transferred to CH4 + NH3 ice mixtures is by linear electron transfer (LET) that 1.3 eV molecule -1 was absorbed by the ice in 90 minutes. They get flattened at 20 minutes’ irradiation, with fluence of 2.0 x 1014 electrons cm-2. While we got flattened at a dose of 3 x 10 17 photons cm-2. Considering the energy of their electron (1.5 keV) and energy of our photons, they got flattened at 3x10 17 eV cm-2 while we get flattened at 27.81x10 17 eV cm-2. Comparing these energy dose, less electrons are needed to flatten the formation of CN-.
%Comparing our CN- obtained after infinitely long exposure, 13 – 16 ML of CN- was obtained by electron irradiation depending on which equation they choose to fit. In our MDHL experiments, we have 14.8 ML of CN-. However, Kim & Kaiser (2011) adopted the CN- absorption coefficient measured by Georgieva & Velcheva (2006) to be 3.7 x 10-18 cm molecule -1, which is 4.86 times smaller. We do not adopt this absorption coefficient because it violates the carbon balance that number of CN- produced will be larger than CH4 consumption. If we adopted the same absorption coefficient, the production yield of CN- should be multiplied by 4.86. Therefore, our yield is 72 ML of CN-. Regarding percentage of NH3 (limiting reactant), Kim & Kaiser has 5 - 6 % yield where we have 12 % yield if we adopted the same absorption coefficients. To conclude, although electron irradiation can
