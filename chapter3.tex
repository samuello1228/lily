\section{Laboratory Astrophysics}
To study the chemical reactivity in astrophysical environment experimentally,
we conducted our experiments in Interstellar photoprocessing system (IPS) (Chen et al. 2014),
an ultrahigh vacuum chamber with base pressure $3 \times 10^{-10}$ torr and 14 K,
corresponds to a density of $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$, similar to dense cloud interiors.
The system will be introduced in detail in section 2.1.1.
To simulate the irradiation in interstellar environments,
we use a micro-wave discharge hydrogen lamp (MDHL) and monochromatic extreme-ultraviolet irradiation (EUV) 30.4 nm to irradiate our ice mixtures,
and they will be introduced in section 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively.
The experimental protocols will be elaborated in section 2.3.
In order to better understand the physics behind, some basic theories of Infrared spectroscopy and concepts of chemical kinetics used in data analysis are included in section 2.4 and 2.5 respectively.
To demonstrate the ice mixtures in KBOs, we used different configurations of ice mixtures that refers to different sections in chapter 3 and chapter 4.
